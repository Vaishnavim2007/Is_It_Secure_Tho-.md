##  Is_It_Secure_Tho
METHODS: <br/>
•	Open rebel_ctf.pcapng file in Wireshark and by searching about protocol we can find that HTTP is an unsecured protocol that means data transferd via http is not encrypted and can easily intercepted <br/>
•	By filtering we can isolate http packets  and then systematically scroll through each of the packets from where we will get packet in  which the respective flag is hidden  <br/>
•	By opening that packet we will get the flag  <br/>
WHAT I LEARNED: <br/>
http is an insecured protocol <br/>
I got a better understanding on the difference between secured and unsecured protocol
